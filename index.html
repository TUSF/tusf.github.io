		<p>Hello there! I'm an asp&shy;iring fantasy fiction writer and tech en&shy;thu&shy;si&shy;ast. This whole website was written comp&shy;lete&shy;ly by hand. Because website builders are overrated. (And I may be a little deranged)</p>
		<p>I've always loved day&shy;dream&shy;ing and making up stories and worlds that take me on endless adventures. I have now made my child&shy;hood habit of dozing off in class into my goal. As a result, most of my work consists of web serials and in&shy;comp&shy;lete worlds that I've come to revisit and recraft.</p>
		
		<p class="dub">A strangely unrelated hobby of mine is programming, which I got into as a teen when I wanted to design a fan-website that has long since died. Although my specific interests have shifted, I still program as a hobby, and have found my strange sense of organization has brought me to hand-write this website's HTML and CSS.</p>
